# Circle
And polygons
by David G. (4mad)

This program is my attempt at 2-d collision detection.

The current goal for 1.0 is a program that can detect collisions between 
  regular convex polygons, circles, lines, line segments, and points.
In addition to collision detection there will be a simple pathfinging algorithm, a real vs virtual map display,
  geometry prediction, geometry generator, and a map simplification algorithm.

Currently the collision accuracy is at worst 1%, however I want to improve it to to 0.1%.

Ultimately I want to optimize this program to work at the very minimum (60 fps) on an i5-3230m (@ 2.6ghz) with an intel hd 4000 gpu running a simple sqaure map with one static circle and one dynamic square.
